# 🎬 VCEngine – Version Control Engine for Video

VCEngine is an **open-source version control system for video**, inspired by how Git manages source code.  
It enables **efficient video collaboration**, storage optimization, and advanced versioning—helping creators, teams, and enterprises manage evolving video projects without duplicating entire files.

---

## 🚀 Why VCEngine?

- Traditional editing workflows create **duplicate video copies** for minor edits → high storage & costs.
- VCEngine stores **video at segment level (4–5s chunks)** → saves storage and optimizes costs.
- Adds **Git-like collaboration**: branches, versions, pull requests, issues, and reviews—for videos.
- Suitable for **content creators, agencies, startups, OTT platforms, and enterprises**.
